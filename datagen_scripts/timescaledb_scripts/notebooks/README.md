# Jupyter notebook mockup

A sample notebook to mock up some possible interactions with the database.

* Use python 3 (I used 3.6.7 specifically).
  * Recommend using pyenv to manage multiple python versions.
* You can then use pipenv to install dependencies: `pipenv install`
* Then ensure your database is running with the test data, and run the notebook: `pipenv run jupyter notebook`
